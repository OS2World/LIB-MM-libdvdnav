       Short Description: libdvdnav v4.2.1 for OS/2
        Long Description: libdvdnav v4.2.1 for OS/2.
The forked version by MPlayer team.
libdvdnav is a library that allows easy use of sophisticated DVD navigation
features such as DVD menus, multiangle playback and even interactive DVD games.
All this functionality is provided through a simple API which provides the
DVD playback as a single logical stream of blocks, intermitted by special
dvdnav events to report certain conditions. The main usage of libdvdnav is a
loop regularly calling a function to get the next block, surrounded by
additional calls to tell the library of user interaction.
The whole DVD virtual machine and internal playback states are completely
encapsulated.
